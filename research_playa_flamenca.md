- Market context: High demand, €200,000-€500,000 for 2-3 bed properties near Zenia Boulevard (2025 prices); 7.7% pop growth correlates to new builds.[1]

### 1. Average Rental Yield Percentage
Typical gross rental yields for investment properties in Playa Flamenca and surrounding "value coast" areas (Torrevieja/Orihuela Costa) range from **4% to 6.5%**, with short-term holiday rentals achieving higher ends due to 62% median occupancy and €72 average daily rates nearby[2].

### 2. Tourist Rental License (VUT/VV) Availability and Requirements
Vivienda Vacacional (VV) or Vivienda con Fines Turísticos (VUT) licenses are available but regulated under Valencian Decree 28/2023. Requirements include:

### 5. Occupancy Rates for Vacation Rentals
Median occupancy is **62%** (226 nights/year) in Torrevieja/Playa Flamenca area, with peaks at 90%+ in summer. Strong demand from Northern Europeans sustains rates above Spanish coastal averages[2].

### 6. Property Management Costs
Professional management firms (e.g., in Torrevieja or Orihuela Costa) charge **20-30% of rental income** for short-term (cleaning, check-ins, marketing via Airbnb/Booking.com) or **8-12%** for long-term. Expect €1,500-€3,000/year for a 2-bed unit, including maintenance[2].

### 7. Community Fees (Comunidad) Typical Ranges

- Orihuela Costa restrictions: Zoning bans in saturated areas; fines €3,000-€600,000 for unlicensed operation.

### 10. Future Development Plans Affecting Property Values
South Costa Blanca (including Playa Flamenca) forecasts **5-8% price growth in 2026**:
- **+7% (Bankinter)**: Land release bottlenecks easing.
- **+6.3% (CaixaBank)**: High demand (720,000 national sales/year).
- **+5.3% (BBVA)**: Coastal premium up to 7%.
New infrastructure: AP-7 highway expansions, Torrevieja hospital upgrades (5 km), sustainable tourism plans boost values 4-7% YoY. Dr. Gonzalo Bernardos predicts boom through 2027 from undersupply[3][4]. Properties near La Zenia or Playa Flamenca promenade poised for strongest appreciation[1][5].
