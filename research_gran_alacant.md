## Investment & Rental

### 1. Average Rental Yield Percentage
Gran Alacant offers **strong rental yields of 6–9%** for properties in emerging Costa Blanca areas like this one, driven by high demand for both long-term and holiday rentals amid limited supply.[4] This aligns with broader Costa Blanca trends, where yields remain attractive compared to other European markets due to population growth, remote workers, and tourism.[2]

### 2. Tourist Rental License (VUT/VV) Availability and Requirements
Tourist rental licenses (VUT - Vivienda de Uso Turístico, or VV in Valencian Community) are available in Gran Alacant, part of Santa Pola municipality, but subject to local quotas and approvals. Requirements include:
- Property registration with Andalusia's tourism registry (or Valencian equivalent for Alicante).
- Minimum standards: safety certificate, occupancy limit (e.g., 4-6 people for 2-3 bed properties), furnished kitchen, Wi-Fi, and energy efficiency label.
- Application via Santa Pola Town Hall; processing time 1-3 months; fees ~€200-500 initially, plus annual renewals.
Availability is good in residential urbanizations like those near Carabassí Beach (3km from center), but some municipalities cap licenses to control tourism pressure.[4] No specific Gran Alacant restrictions noted beyond standard Valencian rules.

### 3. Average Rental Prices per Month (Long-Term)
Long-term rentals (11+ months) in Gran Alacant average **€650-€1,500/month** for 2-3 bedroom bungalows or townhouses (80-120m²), equating to **€12.72/m²**.[1] Examples:
- 2-bed bungalow near Aldi Supermarket and Gran Alacant shopping center: €800-€1,000/month.
- 3-bed house with basement in quiet residential area: €1,000/month.
- Senior resort villas (1-2 beds, +55 only): €2,000-€2,700/month (all-inclusive).[1]
Prices are 4-7% higher in 2026 forecasts due to demand.[2]

### 4. Average Daily Rates for Tourist Rentals by Season
Seasonal/short-term (tourist) rates for 2-bed townhouses with sea views (e.g., first-line near Carabassí Beach) range **€50-€100/night**, varying sharply by season:[1]
- Low season (Nov-Feb): €50-60/night (~€1,500/month).
- Shoulder (Mar-May, Oct): €60-80/night (~€1,750-€2,000/month).
- Peak (Jun-Sep): €80-110/night (~€2,250-€3,000/month, e.g., Aug €3,000).[1]
Rates reflect proximity to Arenales del Sol beaches (2-3km) and Santa Pola (5km).

### 5. Occupancy Rates for Vacation Rentals
Specific Gran Alacant data is limited, but Costa Blanca vacation rentals achieve **70-85% annual occupancy** in coastal spots like this, boosted by tourism and expat demand.[2][4] High season (Jun-Aug) hits 90-95%; low season 50-60%. Strong 2026 outlook from sustained tourism and limited supply supports these rates.[2]

### 6. Property Management Costs
Typical costs for full-service management (marketing, cleaning, maintenance, guest handling) in Gran Alacant: **20-30% of rental income** for tourist lets, or €50-100/month fixed for long-term.[1] Senior resorts bundle services (electricity, water, Wi-Fi, 24/7 assistance) into rent, reducing owner outlay.[1] Agencies like Habitale Alicante charge no commission on some long-term deals.

### 7. Community Fees (Comunidad) Typical Ranges
In Gran Alacant urbanizations (e.g., near multi-sports courts, communal pools, gardens), **€30-€80/month** for bungalows/townhouses, covering pool maintenance, gardens, and security.[1] Higher in gated senior resorts (€100+/month with extras like emergency assistance). Fees stable amid 5-7% property value growth.[4]

### 8. IBI (Property Tax) Rates
IBI (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) in Santa Pola/Gran Alacant: **0.4-0.8% of cadastral value** annually (e.g., €300-€800/year for €150,000-€250,000 property, 100m²).[4] Paid yearly to town hall; non-residents same rate. Valencian averages apply, with no 2026 hikes noted.

### 9. Regulations Affecting Short-Term Rentals
- **VUT license mandatory** for <11 month stays; fines up to €600,000 for unlicensed operation.
- Santa Pola limits total licenses per zone; quieter residential areas (e.g., near Natural Park) more flexible than Barcelona-style bans.[4]
- Noise/community rules strict in family-oriented urbanizations; max 30 days/guest.
- 2026: Costa Blanca "traditionally more flexible" than other regions, but potential quota tightening from overtourism.[4] EU digital nomad visa boosts long-term demand.

### 10. Future Development Plans Affecting Property Values
Gran Alacant poised for **5-8% revaluation in 2026** as an "emerging area" with scarcity of new builds, solid international demand (40%+ foreign buyers in Alicante coast).[4] Key factors:
- Infrastructure: Proximity to Alicante Airport (15km), A-7 highway; expansions in Santa Pola port/marina (5km).
- No major projects specified, but regional trends favor coastal stability: mild climate (18-30°C year-round), healthcare, expat communities.[2][5]
- Risks: Slower European growth could temper premium sales, but rental strength (6-9% yields) underpins values.[2][4]

**Investment Summary for Scandinavian Buyers**: Gran Alacant suits retirees/families with **€150,000-€300,000 entry** for 2-3 bed properties yielding 6-9%, near Carabassí Beach, Aldi, and clinics. Population ~10,000 (growing); 2km to Sweden-friendly expat hubs. Strong 2026 outlook from tourism/residential balance.[1][2][4]
