### 3. Why Swedes Love It
Swedes (and Nordics) favor Rinc¾n for its **top-ranked well-being** (highest in Mßlaga province, #1 per capita income in AndalucÝa per Synthetic Economic Welfare Index), mild climate, beaches, quality of life, and infrastructure funding boosts post-50k population milestone.[1][7]  
Proximity to Mßlaga (15km), low density vs. Torremolinos/Fuengirola, family appeal, and EU expat community (3.6%+1.2% Europeans) draw retirees/second-home buyers seeking authentic Costa del Sol without overcrowding.[2][7]

### 4. Market Prices (m▓, Yield)
No 2026-specific sales data in results (latest pop-focused); Costa del Sol residential averages Ç2,500û3,500/m▓ (resale, prime coastal), with Rinc¾n mid-tier due to growth (1.2û1.6% annual pop rise).[2][3][4]  
- **Buy prices**: Apartments Ç2,200û3,200/m▓; villas Ç2,500û4,000/m▓ (inferred from high well-being/demand).[7]  
- **Rental yields**: 4û6% gross (typical Mßlaga suburbs; short-term tourist boost in La Cala/Centro).[inferred from pop growth/income data]  
Municipality growth signals rising values (+Ç1M+ infrastructure funding).[1]

### 5. Schools/Golf
**Schools**: No specifics in results; as 9th-largest Mßlaga municipality (52k pop), expect 5û10 public primaries/secondaries (e.g., IES Torre de Benagalb¾n, La Cala del Moral schools), plus internationals near Mßlaga (15km). High family demo (11,201 under 18).[2][4]  
**Golf**: None directly in Rinc¾n; nearest: Real Club de Campo de Mßlaga (10km west, 36.73░N 4.40░W), Parador de Golf (15km), A±oreta (east in VÚlez-Mßlaga). Appeals to expats via Costa del Sol golf corridor (50+ courses within 30km).[inferred regional]
