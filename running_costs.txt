The average annual property running costs in Spain typically range from **€2,450–€7,900**, varying by property type and location.[1]

Here's a detailed breakdown of essential expenses:

| Expense Category | Annual Cost |
|---|---|
| **IBI (Property Tax)** | €400–€1,500 (0.4–1.1% of cadastral value)[1] |

For a typical €300,000 apartment with community fees, expect approximately **€3,500–€4,500 annually** in ongoing costs.[1] Detached villas without community fees but with pools and gardens typically cost **€5,000–€8,000 annually** due to higher maintenance and utilities.[1]

**Monthly breakdown for utilities:** Water, electricity, and gas typically range from **€100–€300 per month**, depending on property size and usage.[3]

**Important considerations:**

- **Community fees** vary significantly based on amenities and shared facilities, ranging from €50–€300+ monthly.[1] It's crucial to review historical fees and any planned major works before purchase.[1]

- **Building insurance** is often mandatory if you have a mortgage, while contents insurance is optional but recommended.[1]

- These ongoing costs represent approximately **1.5–2% of property value annually**.[1]
