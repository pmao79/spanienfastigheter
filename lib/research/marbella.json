      "content": "Marbella's real estate market in 2024-2025 showed strong growth, with average prices per square meter reaching €5,410 by September 2025 (+9% year-on-year), driven by high foreign demand (over 30% of purchases, including Swedes), limited supply, and luxury segment resilience.[1][2][4][7] The **luxury market** outperformed, with premium zones exceeding €6,000/m² and annual appreciation of 5-8%, fueled by villas, branded residences, and demand from Northern Europeans like Swedes.[1][2][4][9]\n\n### Key Market Trends (2024-2025)\n- **Sales and Demand**: H1 2024 saw 5.4% sales increase in the Golden Triangle (Marbella, Estepona, Benahavís), with 3.16% year-on-year growth; resale properties dominated at 91% of sales.[1] Over 300 new developments in Málaga province added ~8,000 homes in 2025 (+16.75%).[3]\n- **Price Growth**: Marbella €5,410/m² (+9%); Benahavís €5,391/m² (+16.1%); Estepona €4,057/m² (+13.3%). National Spanish average was €2,093.5/m² (+10.4% yoy Q2 2025).[2][4][5] Luxury areas like Río Real–Los Monteros surged +20.7%.[2]\n- **Buyer Profile for Scandinavians**: Swedes ranked among top foreign buyers (after British at 15%), alongside Dutch, with growing interest in villas, sustainable homes, and remote-work features amid strong tourism and lifestyle appeal.[1]\n- **Luxury Investment Focus**: Shift to high-end villas with pools/gardens, gated communities, and modern amenities; no bubble risk due to robust demand and falling rates.[1][2]\n\n### Rental Yields and Tourist Licenses\nSearch results lack specific 2024-2025 **rental yield** data for Marbella, though strong tourism supports short-term rentals via **tourist licenses** (vivienda turística permits), popular for investment properties in the Golden Triangle.[1] Luxury villas and apartments in tourist hotspots like the Golden Mile yield high returns for Scandinavian investors seeking seasonal income, but regulatory hurdles and supply limits apply; yields typically range 4-7% gross in prime Costa del Sol areas based on pre-2025 trends (inferred from demand stability).[1][2]\n\n### 2025 Outlook and Investment Advice for Swedish Buyers\nPositive trajectory expected into 2026, with lower interest rates, sustainable developments, and infrastructure boosting premium/luxury segments (+3-7% in key areas like Estepona/Sotogrande).[1][2] For Swedish expatriates, prioritize turnkey luxury villas (€1-8M) in Benahavís or Estepona for residency (Golden Visa eligible over €500K), tax efficiency (non-habitual resident perks), and year-round appeal; westward shift to Casares/Manilva offers value (+19-29.5% growth).[2] Limited new stock sustains prices; consult local agents for tourist license compliance amid professionalization push.[1][2]",
