      "content": "Orihuela Costa's real estate market in 2024-2025 showed strong growth, with property prices rising 6-15% year-on-year, sales up 6% in 2024 driven by international buyers (including **6.8% Swedish**), and average asking prices reaching **€3,248/m²** for sales and **€12.88/m²/month** for rentals by late 2025.[1][2][4] Forecasts for 2025 indicate moderate price increases of **4-8%**, fueled by tourism, infrastructure, and demand for golf-adjacent properties in areas like Villamartín and Campoamor, with **strong short-term rental yields** supported by tourist licenses.[1][2][3][4][5]\n\n### Key Market Trends 2024-2025\n- **Price Growth**: Alicante province sales rose 15% in 2024; Orihuela Costa saw 6% sales increase, with resale prices up 10.7% nationally to €2,244/m². Local prices doubled from €1,219/m² in 2014 to €2,516/m² by December 2024, peaking at €3,236/m² in August 2025 before a slight 0.87% rise to €3,248/m² in November 2025.[1][2][3][4]\n- **Buyer Profile**: Over **60% foreign buyers** in 2024, led by British (17.5%), German (15.5%), and Swedish (**6.8%**) among 18 nationalities; Scandinavians drawn to climate, healthcare, schools, and Alicante airport access.[1][2]\n- **Forecasts**: National predictions for 2025 range from 4% (Caixabank) to 5-8% (Bankinter, Fotocasa, Idealista); Costa Blanca South, including Orihuela Costa, expects 5-8% due to holiday home demand and remote work trends.[2][5][8]\n\n### Rental Yields and Tourist Licenses\nProperties offer **strong short-term rental potential** from year-round tourism, with average asking rents at **€12.88/m²/month** in August 2025 (up 1.34% from October 2024, from a 2024 low of €10.63/m²/month).[1][3][4][5] Favorable local regulations support holiday rentals via **tourist licenses**, ideal for investors; areas like La Zenia, Playa Flamenca, and Cabo Roig yield high returns due to beaches and proximity to Zenia Boulevard.[1][3]\n\n**Gross rental yield calculation example** (based on 2025 peaks): For a 100m² apartment at €3,248/m² sale price (€324,800 total) renting at €12.88/m²/month (€1,288/month or €15,456/year), yield is approximately **4.8%** (€15,456 / €324,800).[4] Yields appeal to Scandinavian expats seeking income alongside lifestyle benefits like golf courses in Villamartín (top-rated in Spain).[1][3]\n\n### Golf Investment Opportunities\nOrihuela Costa excels for **golf investors**, with world-class courses in Villamartín, Campoamor, and Las Colinas attracting enthusiasts; properties here saw **up to 8% annual appreciation** in 2024-2025.[1][3] Swedish buyers favor these quiet, international communities with sea views, modern amenities, and high rental demand from golf tourists.[1][2]\n\n### Considerations for Swedish Buyers\nStable euro, digital legal processes, and EU residency ease make it accessible; focus on eco-friendly new builds with solar panels for energy efficiency, relevant to Scandinavian preferences. Watch potential non-EU tax surcharges (though Sweden is EU) and short-term rental regulations.[2][3] Market remains active with high turnover in Torrevieja-adjacent Orihuela Costa.[5]",

Events like fashion runways and family parks add community feel.[6]",

      "content": "# Orihuela Costa vs Torrevieja vs Ciudad Quesada: Property Prices & Lifestyle Comparison\n\n## Property Prices\n\n**Orihuela Costa** commands the highest prices at **€3,200/m²** as of mid-2025[1], while **Torrevieja** averages **€2,500–€2,600/m²**[4], and **Ciudad Quesada** sits at **€2,574.63/m²** in 2026[2]. Orihuela Costa is approximately 33% more expensive than Torrevieja[1]. All three regions have experienced strong appreciation: Quesada saw +9.26% growth in 2025[2], Torrevieja grew close to 10% annually[4], and Orihuela Costa is forecast at +4% for 2025[1].\n\n## Lifestyle & Community Character\n\n| Aspect | Orihuela Costa | Torrevieja | Ciudad Quesada |\n|--------|---|---|---|\n| **Primary Appeal** | Golf tourism, leisure, luxury lifestyle[1] | Beach-focused, salt flats, year-round vibrancy[3] | Sun-seekers, residential, investor-friendly[3] |\n| **Expat Demographics** | British (15% of Alicante purchases) and Scandinavian demand[1] | International buyers, value-focused[4] | Strong expat communities, English-speaking services[8] |\n| **Atmosphere** | Sophisticated, resort-oriented with crystalline waters[3] | Vibrant, all-year-round activity[3] | Laid-back living with great infrastructure[7] |\n\n## Investment Returns & Rental Yields\n\n**Orihuela Costa** offers the strongest rental performance. Short-term holiday lets yield **8–12% gross** (with some well-situated apartments exceeding 10%)[1], while long-term rentals average **5–6% gross**[1]. Average long-term rent is €12.30/m² monthly (approximately €920 for a 75m² flat)[1].\n\n**Torrevieja** and **Ciudad Quesada** lack specific yield data in the search results, though Torrevieja's lower entry prices (€2,500–€2,600/m²) may appeal to budget-conscious investors[4].\n\n## Pros & Cons\n\n**Orihuela Costa Pros:** Premium golf courses, established resorts, strong short-term rental demand, Scandinavian buyer presence, high occupancy rates[1]. **Cons:** Highest entry prices, limited new construction due to planning restrictions[1].\n\n**Torrevieja Pros:** Most affordable of the three, beach-focused lifestyle, salt flats attraction, strong annual appreciation (~10%)[4]. **Cons:** Less upscale positioning than Orihuela Costa[1].\n\n**Ciudad Quesada Pros:** Mid-range pricing, thriving expat infrastructure, English-speaking services, excellent value compared to northern Costa Blanca[8]. **Cons:** Limited lifestyle-specific data in available sources.\n\n## Key Consideration for Swedish Buyers\n\nScandinavian demand is explicitly noted for Orihuela Costa and the broader southern Costa Blanca region[1][6], suggesting established Swedish expatriate networks and services in these areas. Orihuela Costa's premium pricing reflects its resort infrastructure and rental yields, while Torrevieja and Ciudad Quesada offer better affordability with comparable appreciation rates.",
