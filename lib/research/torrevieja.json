      "content": "Torrevieja's real estate market in 2024-2025 showed strong price growth of 9-11% annually, averaging €2,278/m² in 2024 and €2,518-2,591/m² in 2025, driven by high demand from **northern European retirees** (including Scandinavians), limited supply, and robust rental yields, making it attractive for **investment with VUT tourist licenses**.[1][2][3]\n\n### Price Trends 2024-2025\n- **2024**: Average €2,278/m² (+9.08% YoY); rentals rose nearly **19%**, supporting yields amid sales price gains.[1][2]\n- **2025**: Average €2,518-2,591/m² (+10.56-10.95% YoY), below Alicante City or Orihuela Costa but competitive for coastal access; Costa Blanca South (Torrevieja) saw 5-8%+ increases in high-demand areas like sea-view properties.[1][2][3]\n- Alicante province (including Torrevieja) grew 8.5% in late 2024, with Q3 2025 at +12.2% for apartments; national trends (+12.5% YoY) and Valencia region (+18.3%) reinforced upward momentum due to supply shortages (~450,000 units nationally).[4][5]\n\n| Year | Avg. Price (€/m²) | YoY Change | Source |\n|------|-------------------|------------|--------|\n| 2023 | 2,088-2,097      | +5.57-6.58% | [2]   |\n| 2024 | 2,278-2,335      | +9.08-11.35% | [2] |\n| 2025 | 2,518-2,591      | +10.56-10.95% | [2] |[1]\n\nGrowth stems from diversified demand (retirees, remote workers, families), infrastructure upgrades (healthcare, bilingual schools, AP-7 access), and tighter credit preventing bubbles—ideal for **Swedish expats** seeking year-round living with healthcare proximity.[1][3]\n\n### Rental Yields and VUT Tourist License Investment\n- **Yields**: Strong due to 19% rental surge in 2024; Torrevieja offers \"high profitability\" via short-term **VUT (Vivienda de Uso Turístico)** licenses or long-term lets, covering costs while enabling personal use—common for non-full-time owners.[1][3]\n- **Investor Appeal**: Lower prices than north Costa Blanca suit budget-conscious Scandinavians; intense turnover and international services (multilingual) boost liquidity; dual-use (rent + appreciate) mitigates risks.[1][3]\n- Regulations: VUT requires local licensing for tourist rentals; demand from holidaymakers and expats sustains income, with no sharp 2026 downturns expected if EU economy holds.[1][3]\n\nSupply lags (limited coastal land, construction delays) signal further 2025-2026 rises, favoring early buys with 60-70% LTV mortgages for non-residents before potential rate hikes.[1][6] For Swedish buyers, Torrevieja's expat community and affordability stand out versus pricier Jávea or Marbella.[1][3]",

      "content": "# Torrevieja's Salt Lakes and Lifestyle Amenities\n\n## The Pink Lagoon\n\n**Laguna Rosa (Pink Lagoon)** is Europe's largest salt lake, covering **1,400 hectares** and located within the **3,700-hectare Las Lagunas de la Mata y Torrevieja Natural Park** on the Costa Blanca.[1][5] The distinctive pink color results from **halobacteria (archaea) and the microalgae dunaliella**, which thrive in the high-salinity environment.[2][7] The color is most vibrant during **summer months (June-September) on bright, sunny days**, particularly in early morning or late afternoon when sunlight hits the water at optimal angles.[1][3]\n\nThe adjacent **Laguna Salada de La Mata** covers **700 hectares** and displays a **green-blue color**, surrounded by a pristine nature reserve that attracts migratory bird species from September to May.[3][4]\n\n## Activities and Access\n\n**Swimming is strictly prohibited** in both lakes due to the delicate ecosystem and active salt cultivation; violations carry fines up to **€6,000**.[1] However, the area offers several alternatives:\n\n- **Scenic tours**: A tourist train departs from the city center for journeys lasting just over one hour through the salt production areas and natural park.[1]\n- **Cycling and horseback riding**: The area around the blue salt lake is excellent for two-wheel and four-legged excursions, with viewpoints overlooking the lakes and salt mountains.[2]\n- **Mud pools**: Near certain access points, therapeutic mud with purported healing properties is available for visitors.[3]\n- **Public access**: A public entrance at Calle Sol in the residential area allows walking along the lake with views of the salt mountains.[2]\n\n## Natural Features and Therapeutic Properties\n\nThe lakes contain **salt concentrations of 300 grams per liter** (compared to 30 grams per liter in seawater), creating the characteristic white salt trails and massive salt mountains visible from the main road.[2] The high salinity is said to offer **therapeutic benefits for respiratory issues and skin conditions**, similar to properties found in the Dead Sea.[3][4]\n\nThe natural park supports diverse wildlife, including **flamingos, herons, scaup, terns, and other migratory water birds**.[2]\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The search results provided focus specifically on the salt lakes themselves. Information about beaches, golf courses, restaurants, and broader lifestyle amenities in Torrevieja is not included in these results. For comprehensive details on those aspects of Torrevieja living relevant to Swedish expatriates, additional sources would be needed.",
