Wettest months (Nov–Jan: 60–90mm) are still drier than Stockholm's rainy summers.[1][3]\n- **Summer dryness**: Nerja's July–Aug rainfall near 0mm enables beach living; Stockholm peaks at 70mm.[3][4]\n- Data variances (e.g., max temps 14–17°C Jan across sources) stem from station locations (e.g., Málaga 40km west); TimeAndDate (1992–2021) and Weather2Travel provide most detailed monthly breakdowns.[3][4][5]\n- For expats: Nerja's sea temps (15–24°C) support year-round swimming, unlike Stockholm's cold Baltic.[1][3]",

      "content": "# Nerja, Spain: Beaches, Caves, and Lifestyle Overview\n\nNerja offers **13 kilometres of coastline** with diverse beaches suitable for various preferences, complemented by natural attractions and a relaxed Mediterranean lifestyle that appeals to expatriates seeking coastal living.\n\n## Beaches\n\nNerja has **at least 10 beaches and coves**[3], with the most notable being:\n\n**Playa Burriana** is the largest and most visited beach, measuring **800m long and 40m wide**[3]. It features **golden sand and crystal-clear, calm waters**[2] with extensive amenities including restaurants, cafés, beach bars, water sports (kayaking, paddleboarding, scuba-diving), and children's play areas[3].\n\n**Playa Calahonda** is **one of the most iconic and photographed beaches in Nerja**[2], located directly below the famous Balcón de Europa. This **small, picturesque beach features golden sand, crystal-clear water, and colourful fishing boats**[2], with an old fisherman's house that serves as a popular photo spot[2].\n\n**Playa Torrecilla** is the **second most popular beach**, artificially widened with **soft sand and shallow, calm waters ideal for families**[3]. It's located a **10-15 minute walk from the town center**[2].\n\nOther notable beaches include **El Salón Beach** (central location near Balcón de Europa with darker sand)[2], **Carabeo Beach** (small, picturesque spot with dramatic rocks, 10 minutes from town center)[2], **El Chorrillo Beach** (hidden gem comprising three small coves surrounded by rocky cliffs)[2], and **Caletilla Beach** (family-friendly, accessible via a 5-minute walk from the old town)[2].\n\n## Natural Attractions\n\nThe **Cueva de Nerja (Nerja Caves)** ranks as the top attraction on TripAdvisor[7], offering a significant cultural and geological experience. The **Balcón de Europa** is the second-ranked attraction[7]—a historic palm-lined balcony overlooking the Mediterranean with views described as \"genuinely breathtaking\"[5].\n\n## Lifestyle and Amenities\n\nNerja functions as a compact, walkable destination where **most beaches are just a short walk from the old town**[2], making it convenient for daily beach access without requiring a car. The town features **numerous restaurants, cafés, and chiringuitos (beach bars) serving fresh seafood**[3][5], creating a vibrant dining culture along the waterfront.\n\nThe atmosphere is characterized by **Mediterranean charm with postcard-perfect scenery, palm-lined boulevards, and colourful beach umbrellas**[5]. The town attracts those seeking both active pursuits (water sports, hiking) and relaxation, with options ranging from **busy beaches with full services to secluded coves with minimal facilities**[4].\n\n**Note:** The search results provided do not contain specific information about nightlife venues, restaurants by category, or detailed lifestyle amenities beyond beach-related services. For comprehensive information on dining establishments, bars, and evening entertainment options relevant to Swedish expatriates, additional sources would be needed.",

Vibrant yet relaxed; popular for retirees.[1][5][8]\n- **Torrox**: Split between coastal Torrox Costa (beaches, promenades) and inland Torrox Pueblo (whitewashed streets, authentic Spanish feel). Quiet, family-oriented with good healthcare nearby.[8][9]\n- **Frigiliana**: Picturesque inland white village (Pueblo Blanco), car-free center, hiking trails, artisan shops. Most traditional and serene, with mountain views.[3][6][7]\n\n### Pros and Cons\nTailored for Swedish expatriates valuing nature, community, and low-density living over urban hustle.\n\n- **Nerja**:\n  | Pros | Cons |\n  |------|------|\n  | Prime sea views, international amenities, strong rental yields for holiday homes.[1][5] | Higher costs; tourist crowds in summer; steeper terrain.[1][8] |\n\n- **Torrox**:\n  | Pros | Cons |\n  |------|------|\n  | Affordable entry, dual coast/village options, year-round microclimate (Europe's mildest winters).[9] | Fewer luxury properties; less expat networking than Nerja.[8][9] |\n\n- **Frigiliana**:\n  | Pros | Cons |\n  |------|------|\n  | Cheapest prices, authentic culture, proximity to Nerja beaches (10 min); ideal for nature lovers.[2][3][7] | Inland (no direct beach), narrow roads, limited large plots for Scandinavian-style homes.[3][6] |\n\nFor Swedish buyers, Frigiliana maximizes value and tranquility, Nerja offers investment upside, and Torrox balances affordability with coast access—verify latest listings via local agents like Casa Care for expatriate support.[8] Data gaps exist for Torrox averages; prices may rise 5–10% annually in Axarquía due to Northern European demand.[5]",
