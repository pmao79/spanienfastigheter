      "content": "Fuengirola's real estate market has experienced significant growth in 2024-2025, with strong investment potential driven by rising property values and robust rental demand, making it an attractive option for Swedish buyers seeking Costa del Sol properties.\n\n## Market Growth and Price Trends\n\nForeign investment in Spanish property increased by approximately **15% in 2024**, with Fuengirola recording one of the fastest growth rates on the Costa del Sol[1]. Property prices have risen substantially: average asking prices reached **€4,671 per square meter in August 2025**, representing a **17.69% increase compared to September 2024**[3]. Over the longer term, average property prices in Fuengirola have risen by over **10% since 2023**[2].\n\nThe market showed continued momentum into early 2026, with the average price in November 2025 reaching **€4,798 per square meter**, a **17.92% increase compared to December 2024**[3]. This positions Fuengirola as one of the Costa del Sol's fastest-growing property markets[1].\n\n## Rental Yield and Investment Returns\n\nFuengirola offers **strong rental yields** due to consistent tourism demand and growing residential appeal[1]. The rental market has expanded with average asking prices for rental properties at **€15.31 per square meter monthly in August 2025**, up **3.73% compared to September 2024**[3]. Rental growth is expected to continue, though potentially at a slower pace than the 10%+ annual increases observed in 2023-2024[4].\n\nThe combination of affordability relative to nearby Marbella and Estepona, steady short-term holiday rental demand, and long-term residential rental opportunities creates multiple income streams for investors[1][2].\n\n## Neighborhood Variations and Value\n\nPrice variations exist across neighborhoods. **Torreblanca del Sol** commands the highest prices at **€5,116 per square meter**, while **Los Pacos** offers the most affordable options at **€3,199 per square meter**[3]. Emerging value areas include **Carvajal** and the outskirts, which combine lower property prices with growing infrastructure and rental demand[2]. **Los Boliches** and **Torreblanca** are highlighted as particularly attractive for long-term investment[2].\n\n## Why Fuengirola Attracts International Buyers\n\nThe market benefits from proximity to Málaga Airport, excellent transport infrastructure, and a well-developed lifestyle with beaches, restaurants, and modern amenities[1]. Demand comes from a diverse buyer mix: retirees seeking permanent residence, holiday home purchasers, and investors targeting rental income[2]. The expansion of Málaga's technology park is also driving professional migration to the region, supporting sustained housing demand[4].\n\n## Market Maturity and Outlook\n\nThe Costa del Sol market in 2025 has transitioned into a **more mature, transparent, and investment-driven environment**[8], suggesting more stable, predictable returns compared to earlier rapid-growth phases. While Fuengirola remains more affordable than premium Costa del Sol locations, Swedish buyers should note that currency fluctuations between EUR and SEK can affect overall investment costs[2].",

The beach is lined with the **Paseo Marítimo Rey de España**, a scenic promenade featuring numerous **chiringuitos** (beach bars) and restaurants specializing in fresh seafood[1]. Notable establishments include La Mar Salá, known for fried fish and *espetos* (grilled sardine skewers), and Oasis, recommended by the Repsol Guide for seafood rice dishes[2].\n\nWater activities include snorkeling just meters from shore and paddleboarding[2]. The beach also has sports facilities including a bio-healthy equipment area, calisthenics area, and children's play areas[3].\n\n## Location and Accessibility\n\nLos Boliches is centrally located in Fuengirola, positioned between Torreblanca and the town center[8]. It sits just 100 meters from Casa Alise and is easily accessible from downtown Fuengirola without requiring a car[4]. Parking is available nearby, though spaces are in high demand during summer[2].\n\n## Nearby Attractions\n\nWithin walking distance or short train ride are **Bioparc** (a zoo), **Sohail Castle**, and the **Miramar shopping center**[1]. The Roman archaeological site Finca del Secretario, featuring a well-preserved bath complex, is also nearby[2].\n\n## Other Fuengirola Beaches\n\nFuengirola has seven kilometers of coastline with multiple beaches[5]. **Carvajal Beach** is listed among the town's beaches with fine dark sand and calm swimming conditions[3]. The town's beaches collectively offer water parks, mini amusement parks, and diverse recreational facilities[5].",
