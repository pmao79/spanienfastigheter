By November 2025, prices had risen further to **€3,617 per square meter**, up **13.92% from December 2024**[2]. This sustained growth reflects strong demand from both tourists and long-term residents[1].\n\nPrices vary significantly by neighborhood. The **Platja de Ponent area commands the highest prices at €4,425 per square meter**, while the **Centre area offers the most affordable options at €2,789 per square meter**[2].\n\n## Rental Yield and Investment Returns\n\nBenidorm offers competitive **rental yields of 5.7% per year**, driven by millions of annual tourists and strong demand for both short-term and long-term rentals[1]. This makes it particularly attractive for investors seeking passive income compared to other Spanish coastal regions[1].\n\nRental prices in August 2025 averaged **€15.47 per square meter monthly**, though this represented a slight **2.77% decrease from September 2024**[2]. The Platja de Ponent area commands the highest rental rates at **€17.40 per square meter monthly**[2].\n\n## Property Types and Price Ranges\n\nInvestment options span multiple categories:\n\n- **Studios**: €100,000–€180,000 (ideal for budget-conscious investors)\n- **One- and two-bedroom apartments**: €150,000–€300,000 (suitable for seasonal rentals)\n- **Penthouses**: €400,000–€1 million+ (for premium investments)\n- **Villas**: €500,000–€2 million (outside city center)\n- **Commercial real estate**: €300,000–€5 million[1]\n\nApproximately **80% of available properties are secondary market housing** (often from the 1970s-2000s requiring renovation), while **20% are new buildings** with modern amenities[1].\n\n## Investment Considerations\n\nThe market benefits from limited housing supply due to Benidorm's geographic constraints (surrounded by mountains), supporting long-term price appreciation[1]. However, investors should be aware of potential risks, including oversupply in the budget studio segment and possible future restrictions on short-term rental regulations, as other Spanish regions have already implemented such limitations[1].\n\nThe Spanish housing market broadly showed strong performance, with **366,773 existing dwellings sold in the first eight months of 2025** (up 13.5% year-over-year) and **103,187 new dwellings sold** (up 26.1% year-over-year)[5].\n\nRegarding VUT (tourist licenses) and Airbnb regulations, the search results do not contain specific current information about licensing requirements or restrictions in Benidorm for 2025-2026. I recommend consulting with a local real estate agency or legal advisor specializing in Spanish property law for current regulations on short-term rental permits.",

      "content": "**Benidorm offers the lowest entry-level property prices at around €3,175/m² with high rental yields from tourism, while Calpe averages €2,800/m² appealing to permanent residents and holiday buyers, and Altea commands higher prices of €3,200–€3,538/m² for its authentic, upscale vibe favored by international buyers including Scandinavians.[1][2][3][5]**\n\n### Property Prices Comparison (2025–2026 Data)\nPrices vary by property type, location (e.g., sea views), and recent trends showing 5–11% annual increases across Costa Blanca North.[1][3][4][5][9] Focus on Scandinavian preferences for coastal views, community, and investment stability.\n\n| Location  | Avg €/m² (Overall) | Apartments (Starting) | Villas (Starting/Range) | Notes for Swedish Buyers |\n|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Benidorm** | €3,175[1] | €120,000 (2-bed high-rise)[2] | €500,000+ (luxury sea-view)[2] | Tourism-driven; high short-term rental yields year-round. Budget-friendly for investors, but skyscrapers may feel less \"Scandi-natural.\"[1][2] |\n| **Calpe**   | €2,800 (up to €4,500 sea-view villas)[1] | €150,000–€300,000 (2-bed, sea views)[2] | €300,000–€1m+[2] | Mix of residents/holiday homes; culinary scene, high-rises. Good value for families seeking sandy beaches and steady appreciation.[1][2] |\n| **Altea**   | €3,201–€3,538 (Mar–Jun 2025)[3][5]; apartments €3,616[4] | €150,000–€200,000[2] | €300,000+ (€1m+ luxury views); €4200–€4300/m² in Altea Hills[5] | Premium growth (10%+ YoY); pebbly beaches, clear water. Popular with expats for tranquil old town, art, and stable second-home demand.[3][4][5] |\n\nAdditional costs: Expect ~12% extra for taxes (ITP/VAT), notary, legal, and community fees.[1]\n\n### Lifestyle Comparison\n- **Benidorm**: Lively nightlife, skyscrapers, year-round tourism. Vibrant but crowded; suits party-seekers or rental investors. Less serene for relaxed Scandi living.[1][2]\n- **Calpe**: Culinary focus, sandy beaches, high-rises with views. Balanced for families/permanent moves; larger, varied atmosphere.[1][2][3]\n- **Altea**: Tranquil, authentic cobbled streets, art galleries, hillside villas. Pebbly beaches with clearer water; ideal for quality-of-life expats valuing culture and community. Moderate cost of living (e.g., €960/month rent).[3]\n\n### Pros and Cons (Tailored for Scandinavian Expatriates)\n**Benidorm**  \nPros: Affordable entry, high rental income from tourists, easy access.[1][2]  \nCons: Noisy, tourist-heavy; less charm or nature for understated Nordic preferences.[1][2]\n\n**Calpe**  \nPros: Value pricing, beaches, food scene; attracts Northern Europeans for residency.[1][2][3]  \nCons: Livelier than Altea; fewer exclusive enclaves.[3]\n\n**Altea**  \nPros: Authentic vibe, strong investment (29% rental demand rise), expat-friendly with stable growth; serene for long-term living.[3][5]  \nCons: Higher prices, pebbly beaches; premium locations like Altea Hills demand bigger budgets.[3][5]\n\nPrices rose 9–10% in 2025, driven by foreign demand (UK, Germany, Scandinavia); check current listings for sea-view options suiting remote-working Swedes.[1][4][5][9]",
