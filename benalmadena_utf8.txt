### 3. Why Swedes Love It
Swedes are drawn to Benalmßdena for its **warm Mediterranean climate** (300+ sunny days/year), **affordable coastal living** versus northern Europe, **expansive beaches/promenades**, and **Nordic expat networks** in Costa del Sol (Swedish schools/churches nearby in Mßlaga/Fuengirola).[7] The mix of vibrant marinas (like Puerto Marina), golf courses, and retiree-friendly demographics (median age ~39û42, growing 35û59 group) appeals to families and seniors seeking a "second home" lifestyle with easy flights from Sweden.[2][5][7]

### 4. Market Prices (m▓, Yield)
Average residential prices hover at **Ç2,500û3,500/m▓** across Costa del Sol, with Benalmßdena at the higher end due to tourism growth (luxury coastal: Ç3,500û4,500/m▓; inland: Ç2,000û2,800/m▓).[7] Rental yields average **4û6%** in the area, driven by tourist demand (Airbnb/short-term) and population boom (+1,000/year), making it a "housing shock" hotspot amid Spain's market surge.[1][7] Specific 2025û2026 data limited; expect upward pressure from 3.47% annual growth (2020û2023).[5][7]

### 5. Schools/Golf
**Schools**: International options include Swedish School Costa del Sol (nearby Fuengirola, serving Benalmßdena expats), British School of Mßlaga (branches), and local Spanish public schools in each district (e.g., IES Benalmßdena in Arroyo). Focus on bilingual/IB programs for expats; ~14,700 under-18s municipality-wide.[3]  
**Golf**: Torrequebrada Golf (18-hole, par-72, ~36.590, -4.572), one of 10+ Costa del Sol courses nearby; others include La Siesta Golf, Rinc¾n de Lola. Appeals to retirees with sea views and mild winters.[7]
