The **VUD ID requirement for short-term rentals in Spain began on July 1, 2025**[1][4]. From that date, all short-term rental properties must display a valid national identifier (VUD ID/NRA) to appear on platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo[1][4]. Listings without this ID must be removed by platforms within 48 hours[5].

However, I cannot provide information about EURIBOR trends for 2025, as the search results do not contain any data on this topic. To get current EURIBOR information, you would need to consult financial sources or the official EURIBOR website.
