*Generated: 2026-01-22 06:04*



## Demographics & Population

I cannot provide comprehensive answers to most of your specific questions about La Manga del Mar Menor based on the available search results.

## What the Search Results Reveal

The search results confirm that **La Manga del Mar Menor is a coastal destination in Murcia's Campo de Cartagena region**[2][3], and that it experiences **seasonal tourism peaks during June-July-August and September**[2]. The area is described as "not very touristic" compared to major Spanish coastal destinations, with many Spanish domestic tourists visiting during peak season[2].

## Data Gaps

Unfortunately, the search results do not contain:

- **Total population figures** for La Manga del Mar Menor specifically (2023/2024 census data)
- **Population growth trends** over the past 5 years
- **Percentage of foreign residents** in La Manga del Mar Menor
- **Number of Scandinavian/Nordic residents** (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish)
- **Age demographics breakdown** for the area
- **Specific seasonal population variation** statistics (summer vs. winter)
- **Number of registered properties/housing units**

While the search results mention that **Cartagena city proper has a population of 219,235 as of 2024**[1] and that **15.2% of Cartagena's population is foreign-born**[1], these figures apply to the larger Cartagena municipality, not specifically to La Manga del Mar Menor, which is a distinct coastal resort area within the broader region.

To obtain the detailed demographic and housing data you require for La Manga del Mar Menor specifically, you would need to consult local municipal records, the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE), or specialized real estate databases focused on the Murcia region.

## Property Market & Prices

## Climate & Weather

La Manga del Mar Menor benefits from one of **Europe's healthiest climates**, characterized by mild winters and abundant sunshine year-round[1].

## Sunshine & General Climate Profile

**La Manga receives 300+ sunny days annually**[1], making it exceptionally bright compared to Northern European standards. The region experiences **average winter temperatures of 18–20°C**[1], with the sea itself reaching approximately **15–17°C in winter months**[1]. During summer, the lagoon (Mar Menor) side warms to **up to 33°C**[2], creating ideal conditions for water activities.

## Seasonal Temperature Patterns

While the search results do not provide a complete month-by-month breakdown, the available data indicates:

- **Winter months (December–February):** 18–20°C average[1]

## Climate Characteristics

The region features:

- **Low humidity levels**[1]
- **Rarely extreme rain or cold**[1]

## Microclimatic Factors

La Manga del Mar Menor has a unique geographical advantage: it is a **narrow strip of land bordered by both the calm, warm Mar Menor lagoon (33°C) and the Mediterranean Sea**[2][3]. This dual-water configuration creates distinct microclimatic conditions on each side, with the lagoon side offering warmer, calmer waters ideal for swimming and water sports.

## Best Months for Visiting/Living

**Winter (November–March)** is highlighted as particularly attractive for Northern European residents[1]. The mild temperatures make outdoor living enjoyable year-round, with activities including beach walks, cycling, and exploration of natural reserves[1]. Peak tourist season occurs **June–August and possibly September**[3], making winter and shoulder seasons preferable for those seeking a quieter experience.

## Comparison to Scandinavian Climates

The search results do not provide direct climate comparisons to Stockholm or Gothenburg. However, the contrast is substantial: La Manga's **18–20°C winters with 300+ sunny days**[1] represent a dramatic improvement over Scandinavian winters, which typically feature temperatures below 0°C, limited daylight, and frequent precipitation.

## Data Limitations

The search results do not include specific information on:
- Annual rainfall in millimeters
- Precise monthly temperature averages
- Relative humidity percentages
- Detailed seasonal sea temperature variations

These metrics would require additional sources for comprehensive analysis.

## Neighborhoods & Districts

I appreciate your detailed query, but I must be transparent about the limitations of the available search results. The search results provided contain **insufficient information** to deliver the comprehensive neighborhood-by-neighborhood analysis you've requested.

## What the Search Results Provide

The search results confirm that **La Manga del Mar Menor is a hot market** for property investment, with an **established expat community and beach lifestyle with calm waters**[5]. The area is described as having a **unique location between the Mediterranean Sea and the Mar Menor lagoon**[5], and recent infrastructure improvements include **the opening of a 24-hour police station on January 16, 2026**[4], which enhances security and local services.

The results mention several specific locations within the broader La Manga area, including:
- **La Manga Club** (a resort/golf community)[1][3]
- **La Manga Beach** (where the new police station is located along Gran Vía)[4]
- Specific beaches: Cala del Barco, Pudrimel Beach, La Veneziola Beach, Calafria, Ensenada del Esparto, and Playa Mistral[1]

## Critical Gaps

However, the search results **do not provide**:
- Detailed neighborhood names and boundaries within La Manga del Mar Menor
- Specific price ranges for different districts (one result mentions semi-detached houses from €270,000, but lacks neighborhood specificity)[6]
- Population figures for La Manga neighborhoods
- Climate data specific to the area
- Detailed character descriptions of distinct districts
- Distance measurements between neighborhoods and key landmarks

## Recommendation

To provide the **comprehensive, detailed analysis with specific numbers, statistics, and current 2024/2025 data** that your query requires, I would need search results from:
- Local real estate portals with neighborhood-specific pricing
- Detailed guides to La Manga's urbanizaciones (residential developments)
- Current property listings with geographic data
- Local municipality information about La Manga's administrative divisions

Would you like me to help you formulate a more targeted search, or would you prefer information about the broader Costa Cálida region that might be available through additional searches?
